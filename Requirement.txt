It lists all the necessary Python packages that you need to install in order to run the code successfully:

nltk==3.8.1
spacy==3.5.0
python-docx==0.8.11
pdfplumber==0.7.8
scikit-learn==1.2.2
numpy==1.24.3
Note: Do NOT include spaCy model packages like `en-core-web-sm` in `requirements.txt`.
Install the spaCy model during the build with:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### How to Create requirements.txt

To generate a requirements.txt file, you can also run the following command in your project directory (if the packages are already installed in your environment):


pip freeze > requirements.txt


This will output the exact versions of all installed packages into the requirements.txt file.

### Installing from requirements.txt

Once you have the `requirements.txt` file, you can install all the required libraries by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt


This ensures that the necessary dependencies are installed in your environment before you run the script.
